  QUICK FIX FOR DARK PAGE ON HOSTINGER
==========================================

WHY IS IT DARK?
---------------
Your site has a dark theme. Black page = React app not starting.
Files are probably in wrong location.

QUICK FIX (5 STEPS):
-------------------

1. LOGIN TO HOSTINGER
   → https://hpanel.hostinger.com

2. DELETE EVERYTHING
   → File Manager → public_html
   → Select all → Delete

3. UPLOAD TEST FILE
   → Upload this file: test.html
   → Visit: greenofig.com/test.html
   → Should see GREEN text saying "Hostinger is Working!"

4. UPLOAD ALL FILES FROM DIST FOLDER
   → Location: C:\Users\ADMIN\OneDrive\Desktop\GreeonFig Rocet code\greenofigwebsite\dist

   Upload these files:
   ✓ index.html
   ✓ 404.html
   ✓ favicon.png
   ✓ logo.png
   ✓ robots.txt
   ✓ sitemap.xml
   ✓ assets (ENTIRE FOLDER - has 50+ files inside)

5. CREATE .htaccess FILE
   → In public_html, create new file: .htaccess
   → Copy content from HOSTINGER_FIX_GUIDE.md (Step 5)

6. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE
   → Ctrl + Shift + Delete
   → Select "Cached images and files"
   → Click "Clear data"
   → OR use Incognito mode

7. TEST
   → Visit: https://greenofig.com
   → Should see FULL website (not dark!)

==========================================

STILL DARK? CHECK THIS:
----------------------
→ Press F12, go to Console tab
→ Look for red errors
→ Go to Network tab, refresh page
→ Check if "/assets/index-decb2b81.js" shows 404

IF FILES SHOW 404:
-----------------
→ Delete everything again
→ Make sure you upload from "dist" folder
→ Make sure "assets" folder uploaded with files inside
