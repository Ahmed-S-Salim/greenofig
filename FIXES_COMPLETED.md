## 2. Coupon Codes & Referral System

### Status
The coupon and referral components are working correctly in the code. However, the database tables may not have been applied yet.

### Components Location
- **Coupon Manager:** `src/components/admin/CouponCodesManager.jsx`
- **Referral Manager:** `src/components/admin/ReferralManager.jsx`

### Required Database Tables
I created a file `APPLY_COUPONS_REFERRALS.sql` in your project root that contains the SQL to create these tables:

1. **coupon_codes** - Stores coupon code details and settings
2. **coupon_redemptions** - Tracks who used which coupons
3. **referral_program** - Program settings for referral rewards
4. **referrals** - Tracks referral relationships and rewards

### How to Apply the Tables

**Step 1:** Go to your Supabase Dashboard
- Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID

**Step 2:** Open SQL Editor
- Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

**Step 3:** Create a new query
- Click "New Query"

**Step 4:** Copy and paste
- Open the `APPLY_COUPONS_REFERRALS.sql` file from your project root
- Copy ALL the content
- Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor

**Step 5:** Run the migration
- Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter
- Wait for confirmation message

**Step 6:** Verify
- Go to "Table Editor" in Supabase
- You should see 4 new tables:
  - coupon_codes
  - coupon_redemptions
  - referral_program
  - referrals

## 3. Dev Server Fixed

The dev server is now running successfully on **port 3000**

Access your app at: http://localhost:3000

## 4. What the Components Do

### Coupon Codes Manager
- Create discount coupons with percentage or fixed amount discounts
- Set usage limits (max uses, max uses per user)
- Set validity periods (start/end dates)
- Restrict to specific subscription plans
- Track redemptions
- Enable/disable coupons

### Referral Manager
- View all referrals in the system
- Track referral status (pending, completed, rewarded)
- Configure referral rewards for both referrer and referee
- Mark referrals as rewarded
- View referral statistics
- Search and filter referrals

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the database migrations** using `APPLY_COUPONS_REFERRALS.sql`
2. **Test the components** by logging in as admin and navigating to:
   - Admin Dashboard → Coupons tab
   - Admin Dashboard → Referrals tab
3. **Create test coupons** to ensure everything works
4. **Check for any errors** in the browser console

## Current Status

✅ Duplicate files removed
✅ Dev server running on port 3000
✅ Coupon and referral components are code-complete
⏳ Database tables need to be applied (use APPLY_COUPONS_REFERRALS.sql)
⏳ Testing needed after database migration

## If You See Errors

If the coupon or referral tabs show errors, it's likely because the database tables haven't been applied yet. Follow the steps above to apply `APPLY_COUPONS_REFERRALS.sql` to your Supabase database.
