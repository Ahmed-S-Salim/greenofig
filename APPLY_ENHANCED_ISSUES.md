## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Apply the SQL Migration

1. Open `ENHANCED_ISSUES_SYSTEM.sql` from your project folder
2. Select ALL content (Ctrl+A)
3. Copy it (Ctrl+C)
4. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
5. Select your project
6. Click **"SQL Editor"** in left sidebar
7. Click **"New Query"**
8. Paste the SQL (Ctrl+V)
9. Click **"Run"** button
10. Wait for success message

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

After running the SQL, go to **Table Editor** and verify these new tables exist:

#### Core Tables:
- `issues` (enhanced with new columns)
- `issue_comments`
- `issue_categories`
- `issue_assignments`
- `issue_attachments`
- `issue_activity_log`
- `issue_tags`
- `issue_tag_relations`
- `issue_response_templates`

### Step 3: Check Default Data

The migration automatically inserts:

**Default Categories:**
- Billing
- Technical
- Feature Request
- Bug Report
- Account
- Other

**Default Response Templates:**
- Welcome Message
- Issue Resolved
- Need More Info
- Billing Issue
- Technical Issue

## Database Schema Overview

## Automatic Features

### Triggers (Automatic Actions):

1. **Auto-log Status Changes** - When status changes, automatically creates activity log entry
2. **Auto-log Priority Changes** - Track priority escalations
3. **Auto-log Assignments** - Track who assigned what to whom
4. **Auto-log Creation** - Log when issue is first created
5. **Auto-log Comments** - Track all comments in activity log
6. **Auto-update First Response Time** - When admin first replies, timestamp is recorded
7. **Auto-update Updated_at** - Timestamp updates on any change

### Helper Functions:

1. **`get_issue_statistics(time_period)`**
   - Returns: total issues, open, in progress, resolved, closed, urgent, high priority
   - Also returns: avg first response time (minutes), avg resolution time (hours)
   - Time periods: 'today', 'week', 'month', 'all'

   **Usage:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM get_issue_statistics('week');
   ```

2. **`get_issues_by_category()`**
   - Returns count of open/in-progress issues by category

   **Usage:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM get_issues_by_category();
   ```

3. **`auto_escalate_old_issues()`**
   - Auto-escalates medium → high after 3 days
   - Auto-escalates high → urgent after 7 days
   - Returns number of issues escalated

   **Usage:**
   ```sql
   SELECT auto_escalate_old_issues();
   ```

4. **`get_issue_details(issue_uuid)`**
   - Returns complete issue data including:
     - Issue details
     - Customer profile
     - Assigned user profile
     - All comments with user profiles
     - All attachments
     - Complete activity log
     - All tags

   **Usage:**
   ```sql
   SELECT get_issue_details('issue-uuid-here');
   ```

## Security (RLS Policies)

### For Customers:
- Can view their own issues
- Can create new issues
- Can comment on their own issues
- Can upload attachments to their issues
- **Cannot** see internal admin notes
- **Cannot** see activity log

### For Admins:
- Can view ALL issues
- Can update any issue (status, priority, assignment, etc.)
- Can view and create internal notes
- Can view complete activity log
- Can manage categories, tags, templates
- Can assign issues to team members

## Next Steps - Frontend Implementation

Now that the database is ready, you'll need to update the `IssuesManager.jsx` component to use these new features:

### Priority Updates:
1. **Add filters** (status, priority, category, assigned user)
2. **Add search** (by subject, customer name, email)
3. **Add detailed modal** when clicking an issue
4. **Add comment/reply interface**
5. **Add assignment dropdown**
6. **Add statistics cards** using `get_issue_statistics()`
7. **Add real-time subscriptions** for live updates

Would you like me to create the enhanced React component next?

## Testing the Migration

After applying the SQL, test with these queries:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE 'issue%';

-- View default categories
SELECT * FROM issue_categories ORDER BY display_order;

-- View default templates
SELECT * FROM issue_response_templates;

-- Get current statistics
SELECT * FROM get_issue_statistics('all');

-- View existing issues (if any)
SELECT * FROM issues;
```

## Common Issues

### "relation already exists"
This is OK - means table was already created. The SQL uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and `DO $$` blocks to safely update existing tables.

### "function update_updated_at_column does not exist"
Run the `COMPLETE_ADMIN_TABLES.sql` first - it creates this shared function.

### "permission denied"
Make sure you're logged into Supabase Dashboard as the project owner and using the SQL Editor (not a direct postgres connection).

## Summary

File to apply: **`ENHANCED_ISSUES_SYSTEM.sql`**

This creates:
- 9 new/enhanced tables
- 4 helper functions
- 5 automatic triggers
- Complete RLS policies
- Performance indexes
- Default data (categories & templates)

After applying, you'll have a professional-grade issue tracking system ready for frontend integration!
