## üéì How to Use Everything

// Log user creation
await logActivity(
  ACTIVITY_TYPES.USER_CREATED,
  { name: user.full_name, email: user.email },
  currentUser,
  user.id,
  'user'
);

// Log blog publish
await logActivity(
  ACTIVITY_TYPES.BLOG_PUBLISHED,
  { title: post.title, slug: post.slug },
  currentUser,
  post.id,
  'blog_post'
);
```

### 2. Permission Checking

In components:

```javascript
import { hasPermission, PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/rbac';
import PermissionGuard from '@/components/PermissionGuard';

// Programmatic check
if (hasPermission(user, PERMISSIONS.CUSTOMERS_EDIT)) {
  // Show edit button
}

// Component guard
<PermissionGuard user={user} permission={PERMISSIONS.BLOG_CREATE}>
  <CreateButton />
</PermissionGuard>
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Required: Run Database Migration

**This is the ONLY setup step required!**

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy content from `create-activity-logs-table.sql`
3. Execute the SQL
4. Verify `activity_logs` table is created

That's it! Everything else works out of the box.

### Optional: Configure User Roles

Update user roles in Supabase:

```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET role = 'admin'  -- or super_admin, content_editor, etc.
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

## üí° What's NOT Implemented (Intentionally Deferred)

### Priority 4: Content Management (Optional)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Preview functionality for website managers
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Media library manager UI
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Rich text editor for blog

**Reason**: Current content tools are functional. These are nice-to-haves that can be added later if needed.

### Priority 6: Marketing Tools (Use 3rd Party)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Email campaign manager
- ‚è≠Ô∏è A/B testing framework
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Advanced referral features

**Reason**: Better to use dedicated services like Mailchimp for email campaigns, Optimizely for A/B testing. Integration with these services is more effective than building from scratch.
