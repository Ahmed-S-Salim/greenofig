## 🔧 How the Script Works

The content was inserted using: `insert-all-content.js`

This script:
1. Loads environment variables from `.env.local`
2. Connects to your Supabase database
3. Clears existing demo data (optional)
4. Inserts all recommended content
5. Provides a success summary

**To re-run the script:**
```bash
node insert-all-content.js
```

**Note:** Running the script again will clear and replace all existing content.
