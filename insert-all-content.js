              answer: 'Our AI analyzes your profile (goals, dietary restrictions, preferences, activity level) and generates personalized meal plans optimized for your nutritional needs. Each plan is then reviewed by a certified nutritionist to ensure it\'s safe, balanced, and effective. The AI learns from your feedback, continuously improving recommendations.'
