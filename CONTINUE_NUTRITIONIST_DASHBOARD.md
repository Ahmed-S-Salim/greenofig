## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Next Steps Required

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration to Supabase

**This is a MANUAL step that you MUST complete:**

1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click **"+ New Query"**
4. Open this file on your computer:
   ```
   C:\Users\ADMIN\OneDrive\Desktop\GreeonFig Rocet code\greenofigwebsite\supabase\migrations\20251020_nutritionist_enhancements_clean.sql
   ```
5. Copy the ENTIRE contents of the file
6. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
7. Click **"RUN"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
8. Wait for the query to complete
9. Check for any errors in the results panel
10. Verify tables were created by going to **Table Editor** → you should see new tables like:
    - client_progress
    - client_health_data
    - appointments
    - recipes
    - meal_plans_v2
    - messages
    - client_habits
    - educational_resources
    - etc.

**Why this is critical:** Without this migration, the nutritionist dashboard won't work because the database tables don't exist yet.

---

### Step 2: Test the Nutritionist Dashboard

Once the database migration is applied:

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Log in** with a nutritionist account
   - If you don't have one, create a user and manually change their role to `nutritionist` in Supabase
3. **Navigate to:** `/app/nutritionist`
4. **You should see:**
   - Beautiful sidebar navigation
   - Dashboard overview with stats
   - Navigation items: Dashboard, Clients, Meal Plans, Schedule, Messages, Analytics, Resources

5. **Test each section:**
   - ✅ Dashboard - Should show stats cards
   - ✅ Clients - Should list all users with role 'user'
   - ✅ Meal Plans - Should have create meal plan interface
   - ✅ Schedule - Should show calendar
   - ✅ Messages - Should show messaging interface
   - ✅ Analytics - Should show charts and metrics
   - ✅ Resources - Should show resource library

---

### Step 3: Common Issues and Fixes

#### Issue: "Table does not exist" errors
**Solution:** Make sure you completed Step 1 (database migration)

#### Issue: No clients showing up
**Solution:**
- Create a test user account (role: 'user')
- Or use Supabase Table Editor to add a test user to `user_profiles`

#### Issue: Stats showing 0 everywhere
**Solution:** This is normal! You need sample data. See "Step 4: Add Sample Data" below

#### Issue: Component rendering errors
**Solution:** Check browser console for specific errors and report them

---

### Step 4: Add Sample Data (Optional but Recommended)

To fully test the dashboard, you'll want some sample data:

#### Option A: Manual Entry via Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to Supabase → Table Editor
2. Add entries to these tables:

**client_progress:**
```sql
INSERT INTO client_progress (client_id, nutritionist_id, date, weight_kg, body_fat_percentage)
VALUES ('user-uuid-here', 'your-uuid-here', '2025-10-23', 75.5, 22.3);
```

**appointments:**
```sql
INSERT INTO appointments (nutritionist_id, client_id, title, appointment_date, duration_minutes, status)
VALUES ('your-uuid-here', 'user-uuid-here', 'Initial Consultation', '2025-10-25 10:00:00+00', 60, 'scheduled');
```

**recipes:**
```sql
INSERT INTO recipes (nutritionist_id, name, description, calories_per_serving, protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g)
VALUES ('your-uuid-here', 'Healthy Breakfast Bowl', 'Oats with fruits and nuts', 350, 12, 45, 15);
```

#### Option B: Use the UI to Create Data

Once logged in as a nutritionist:
1. Go to **Clients** → Click a client → Add progress notes
2. Go to **Meal Plans** → Create a new meal plan
3. Go to **Schedule** → Add an appointment
4. Go to **Resources** → Upload an article/guide
