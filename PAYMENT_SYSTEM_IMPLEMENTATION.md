## 🚀 How to Use the New Features

### For Developers:

#### 1. Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI (requires Docker)
npx supabase db reset

# OR manually through Supabase Dashboard
# Copy contents of supabase/migrations/20251017_payment_enhancements.sql
# Run in SQL Editor
```

#### 2. Configure Stripe
1. Get your Stripe API keys from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Add to your payment_settings table:
```sql
INSERT INTO payment_settings (provider, is_active, is_test_mode, public_key, secret_key)
VALUES ('stripe', true, true, 'pk_test_...', 'sk_test_...');
```

#### 3. Import and Use Services

**Create a Checkout:**
```javascript
import { createCheckoutSession, redirectToCheckout } from '@/lib/stripeEnhanced';

const session = await createCheckoutSession({
  planId: 'plan-uuid',
  billingCycle: 'monthly',
  userId: user.id,
  couponCode: 'SAVE20'
});

await redirectToCheckout(session.sessionId);
```

**Generate Invoice:**
```javascript
import { createInvoiceFromTransaction, downloadInvoicePDF } from '@/lib/invoiceGenerator';

// Auto-create from transaction
const invoice = await createInvoiceFromTransaction(transactionId);

// Download PDF
await downloadInvoicePDF(invoice.id);
```

**Send Notifications:**
```javascript
import { notifyPaymentSuccess } from '@/lib/paymentNotifications';

await notifyPaymentSuccess(userId, {
  amount: 29.99,
  planName: 'Pro Plan',
  id: transactionId,
  created_at: new Date(),
  nextBillingDate: new Date()
});
```

#### 4. Add Revenue Analytics to Admin Dashboard
```javascript
// In App.jsx or your routing file
import RevenueAnalyticsPage from '@/pages/RevenueAnalyticsPage';

// Add route
<Route path="admin/revenue" element={<AdminRoute><RevenueAnalyticsPage /></AdminRoute>} />
```

## 🔄 Next Steps (Still To Implement)

10. **Invoice Email Automation** - Auto-send invoices after payment

### Nice to Have:

12. **PayPal Integration** - Alternative payment method
13. **Gift Cards** - Gift card purchase and redemption
14. **Enterprise Features** - Net-30 terms, purchase orders

## 🎯 API Endpoints Needed (Backend)

You'll need to create these backend endpoints for full Stripe integration:

### Required Endpoints:
```
POST /api/stripe/create-checkout-session
POST /api/stripe/webhook
POST /api/stripe/create-payment-intent
POST /api/stripe/attach-payment-method
POST /api/stripe/process-refund
GET  /api/stripe/customer
```

### Example Backend (Node.js):
```javascript
// /api/stripe/create-checkout-session
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

app.post('/api/stripe/create-checkout-session', async (req, res) => {
  const { planId, billingCycle, userId, successUrl, cancelUrl, couponCode } = req.body;

  // Fetch plan from database
  const plan = await getPlanFromDB(planId);

  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    line_items: [{
      price_data: {
        currency: 'usd',
        product_data: {
          name: plan.name,
          description: plan.description,
        },
        unit_amount: (billingCycle === 'yearly' ? plan.price_yearly : plan.price_monthly) * 100,
        recurring: {
          interval: billingCycle === 'yearly' ? 'year' : 'month',
        },
      },
      quantity: 1,
    }],
    mode: 'subscription',
    success_url: successUrl,
    cancel_url: cancelUrl,
    client_reference_id: userId,
    discounts: couponCode ? [{ coupon: couponCode }] : [],
  });

  res.json({ sessionId: session.id, url: session.url });
});
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Never expose secret keys in frontend code**
2. **Always validate webhook signatures**
3. **Use RLS policies** (already implemented in migrations)
4. **Encrypt sensitive payment data**
5. **Log all payment operations for audit**
6. **Implement rate limiting on payment endpoints**
7. **Use HTTPS only in production**

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Docker Required**: Database migrations require Docker Desktop for local Supabase
2. **Backend API Needed**: Real Stripe checkout requires backend endpoints
3. **Email Service**: Notifications created but not actually sent (need email service)
4. **Mock Checkout**: CheckoutDialog still uses mock payment (needs backend integration)
5. **Tax Calculation**: Not implemented yet (placeholder exists)
