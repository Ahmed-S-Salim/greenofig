# Website Fix Summary - Oct 18, 2025

## Problem
The website showed a white blank page after attempting to add website content management features last night around 11 PM.

## Root Cause
The `MessageSquareQuote` icon from `lucide-react` doesn't exist in your version of the package. This caused an import error that crashed the entire application.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed Icon Import Error
- **Problem:** `MessageSquareQuote` icon doesn't exist
- **Solution:** Replaced with `MessageSquare` in:
  - `src/components/admin/WebsiteManager.jsx`
  - `src/components/admin/TestimonialsManager.jsx`

### 2. ✅ Disabled Problematic Components
The following manager components were causing crashes and have been temporarily disabled:
- **HomepageManager.jsx** → Renamed to `.broken`
- **TestimonialsManager.jsx** → Renamed to `.broken`
- **ContactInfoManager.jsx** → Renamed to `.broken`
- **SEOManager.jsx** → Renamed to `.broken`

These buttons now show: "🚧 Feature In-Progress! This content manager is under construction."

### 3. ✅ Cleaned Up Files
- Removed test files and error diagnostic code
- Restored `main.jsx` to normal state
- Removed temporary error handlers from `App.jsx`
- Backed up problematic API files:
  - `websiteApi.js` → `websiteApi.js.backup`
  - `websiteTypes.js` → `websiteTypes.js.backup`
