## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't see all admin tabs

**Cause:** Your user role doesn't have permission

**Solution:**
1. Check your role in database
2. Update role if needed:
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_profiles
   SET role = 'admin'
   WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
   ```

### Problem: Activity Logs tab missing

**Cause:** Either not admin, or table doesn't exist

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're admin/super_admin
2. Run the SQL migration (create-activity-logs-table.sql)

### Problem: Export buttons not working

**Cause:** No data to export, or browser blocking downloads

**Solution:**
1. Ensure there's data in the table/list
2. Check browser's download settings
3. Check browser console for errors

### Problem: "Access Denied" message

**Cause:** You don't have permission for that feature

**Solution:**
- Normal behavior for your role
- Contact super admin to change your role if needed
